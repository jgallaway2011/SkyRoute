# SkyRoute

Vancouver’s public metro system has asked you to help create a program to help commuters get from one landmark to another. You’ll be building out “SkyRoute,” a routing tool that uses breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Python dictionaries to accomplish this feat. For the purposes of this project, you can assume that it takes the same amount of time to get from each station to each of its connected neighboring stations.

App using Depth First Search &amp; Breadth First Search algorithms to find fastest train route between points of interest

## Usage

Clone Github project <br/>
Navigate to project directory <br/>
Run 'python3 skyroute.py' in the terminal.

## Concepts
  Depth First Search Algorithms <br/>
  Breadth Fist Search Algorithms <br/>
  Python Dictionaries, Classes, Functions, & Variables
